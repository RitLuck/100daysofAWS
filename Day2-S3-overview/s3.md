# What is S3?

- Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service in the cloud
- S3 is used to store and retrieve any type of data, such as static assets, images, videos, and documents, and serves as a scalable, durable, and highly available solution for storing data.
- S3 provides a virtually unlimited storage capacity, and can be used to store data from any application running on any platform.
- S3 data is stored in "buckets," which are containers for storing objects. A bucket can be thought of as a top-level folder in a file system.
- Buckets can be configured for different storage classes and access control, depending on the specific use case.
- S3 provides a wide range of features such as versioning, lifecycle policies, object locking, and cross-region replication to provide better data protection and management.
- S3 allows for easy integration with other AWS services such as EC2, Lambda, and CloudFront.
