The AWS (Amazon Web Services) shared responsibility model outlines the division of responsibilities between AWS and its customers in terms of security and compliance in the cloud environment.

The model is divided into two areas: **security of the cloud** and **security in the cloud**. 

**AWS** is responsible for **security of the cloud**, which means protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud. **Customers** are responsible for **security in the cloud**, which means securing the data, applications, operating systems, and other elements that they deploy or host in the cloud.

## AWS's responsibilities (security of the cloud):

- Physical security of data centers, including access control and monitoring
- Network infrastructure, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems
- Hypervisor and virtualization layer
- Global infrastructure, such as edge locations and content delivery networks (CDNs)

## Customer's responsibilities (security in the cloud):

- Security of customer data, including encryption and access control
- Application security, including securing application code and configurations
- Operating system security, including patch management and anti-virus protection
- Network and traffic protection, such as configuring firewalls and securing traffic
